Is WIP a voluntary action or not?

 voluntary in the sense that it gives proprioception so the interaction is not passive
 but still not able to encode expected direction or place ?

 remember expected matching is needed to inhibit the vestibular info*

Sickness - Imbalance 

 Vest - Proprioceptive fusion 과 관련?

 Head 고정 하고 WIP 하면 Sickness 나야 겠지?  그렇게 알려져 있는듯


Strength of visual or vestibular sense
 Tuning 정도 
 Will turning increase if more features? (sparse flow vs. dense flow ... they have 
  same info at the end of the day?)
 
Congruence extent between the two
 overlap between tuning of visual and vestibular to certain direciton/info

still number of neuron wise visual is stronger generally


is really the large FOV have stronger visual 

 can there be other reason of why large FOV cause more sickness or vection or sensory mismatch?
 more tuned?
 less congruency?

Visual and Vestiular can be fused even if different
--> by one of reference
--> 정도의 차이 인듯 차이 너무 크면 fusion 도 안되고 머리만 아프다 ...?

Still it gives evidence of how rev flow might work
 it increases the congruency 
 the strength of visual is weakened -- tuning is weakened


different modality fighting for limited attention resource ...
 but then visual dominance 는 어떻게?
 does each modality have some minimum alloted contribution?

 depends on task
 visual - spatial task
 vestibular - spatial
 audio - temporal / alert

MIsmatch does not necessitate symptom

 SO WIP with head fixed may not give symptom

 proprio --->   
         |---->  two fused and give  body motion 
         |  
 Vest    --->  head motion

In WIP get body motion and head motion 
but in WIP without head motion, get only body motion 
 
threshold for vestibular sensitivity is not high to support daily usual activity
 someone else must help out ... proprio, vision, ...
